# GitHub PR Commit and Labeling Guide for Changelog Generation

This guide explains how to commit, label, and format your PRs to generate a clean and organized changelog using GitHub Actions and `release-please`.

## Commit Messages & Labels

When working with GitHub, commit messages should follow a specific format, and appropriate labels should be applied to each PR. These labels are used to categorize changes in the changelog.

### 1. Adding a New Feature

**Commit Message:**

`git commit -m "feat: add widget shortcode for better customizability"`

**Labels to Apply:**

* Semver-Minor (since this is a new feature)
* enhancement (to indicate it‚Äôs an improvement)

**Changelog Result:**

* This commit will be categorized under Exciting New Features üéâ in the changelog when merged into the main branch.

### 2. Fixing a Bug

**Commit Message:**

`git commit -m "fix: correct widget layout styles for mobile view"`

**Labels to Apply:**

* No labels required (unless you want to explicitly categorize it)

**Changelog Result:**

* This commit will be categorized under Other Changes in the changelog if labeled as chore, fix, or similar.
* Note: Bug fixes typically don‚Äôt need changelog labels but will still appear if they are merged into the release.

### 3. Breaking Change

If you‚Äôre removing an outdated API method or introducing a breaking change:

**Commit Message:**

```
git commit -m "feat: remove deprecated `getData()` method"
```

**Labels to Apply:**

* Semver-Major (since this is a breaking change)
* breaking-change (alternative label to indicate a breaking change)

**Changelog Result:**

* This commit will trigger the workflow to show up under Breaking Changes üõ† in the changelog when merged into main.

### 4. Documentation Update

If you update the README, documentation, or any related content:

**Commit Message:**

`git commit -m "docs: update README with new installation steps"`

**Labels to Apply:**

* ignore-for-release (since this is just documentation)

**Changelog Result:**

* This commit will NOT appear in the changelog, as it is excluded from the release.

## How to Create a Pull Request (PR)

### Step 1: Push Your Commit to GitHub

Once you‚Äôve committed your changes, push them to your feature branch:
git push origin your-branch-name

### Step 2: Open a Pull Request

* Go to your GitHub repo and create a new Pull Request from your feature branch to main (or your primary release branch).
* Add a title for your PR that reflects the changes made.

### Step 3: Apply Labels to the PR

* On the right-hand side of the PR page, there will be a Labels section.
* Choose the appropriate labels based on the type of change:
	
	PR Title
Labels
Resulting Changelog Section
feat: add widget shortcode
Semver-Minor, enhancement
Exciting New Features üéâ
fix: correct widget layout styles
(none)
Other Changes
feat: remove deprecated getData() API
Semver-Major, breaking-change
Breaking Changes üõ†
docs: update README with install steps
ignore-for-release
Not included in changelog

### Step 4: Merge PR and Trigger Changelog

* Once your PR is merged into main, the changelog will automatically update based on the labels.
* The release-please GitHub Action will handle the version bump, changelog entry, and tagging of the release.
